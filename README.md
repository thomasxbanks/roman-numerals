# Convert Arabic numbers to Roman Numerals

When provide with an Arabic number between 1 and 3999, this function will return the value in the equivalent Roman Numerals.

## Unit-tests

Tested using Jasmine. Tests pass.

## Design

I have kept everything to a minimum as building a front-end wasn't specifically part of the brief.
